This project is a good visiual learning experience where it can give a person an added piece of creativity in terms of a nice color design and functions for future projects.

## Features

* The user writes one or more tasks that he or she needs to do. The user can later on mark each task as completed or remove the task if the user has changed their mind. 

* The user can also use the select filter options to see which tasks that has been completed or uncompleted. 

* All the tasks the users create on the site will get stored in the in a local storage so when they return to the page everything will be saved. 

* The task manager has a timer with a start, stop and reset function so the user can track their time. 

* The task manager also has an in real life clock and date tracker.

## Background design

* The color style: linear-gradient(120deg, #e4cdcd, #650404) was used as a background image for this project. This gives the user a fun and beutiful color to watch instead of just one simple and same color.

## Text input field

* The text input field have a clean white background where the user can type their text of tasks. The text has been nicely centered so the text isn't stuck to the edge.

## Text input field button

* Next to the text input field the user can find a button. The button has a hover effect so it changes color when that event happens.

## Checkmark and trashcan buttons

* The checkmark button can be used by the user when a task is completed and will have a line-through effect with some opacity to make it look creative.

## Timer

* Here the user can keep track of their time so they know how much time they have invested for a task.

* The timer consists of hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds in the display.

* The timer has a green start button, a red stop button and a blue reset button.

* All the timer buttons have a hover effect so the colors become brighter and they have a transition effect of background-color 0.5s ease in CSS.

* Adding an edit button for each task incase an user wants to rename a task for future purposes or misspellings.

* Adding a tool which can move around the tasks based on priority.

* Adding a local storage for the timer.

## Unfixed bugs

* There is a problem for Mac users to click on the filter buttons. When the mac user clicks on the buttons they need to click 2 times and when a windows pc computer clicks on the button they only need to press it once. Multiple different individuals and support teams with programming experience have reviewed the bug and haven't been able to solve it yet.

## Deployment

* The deployment was made through github. The step by step process where the following: Settings --> Pages --> Source --> Deploy from a branch --> Main --> /(root) --> Save.
