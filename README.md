## Features

* The user writes one or more tasks that he or she needs to do. The user can later on mark each task as completed or remove the task if the user has changed their mind. The user can also use the select options to see which tasks that has been completed or uncompleted. All the actions the users take on the site will get stored in the in a local storage so when they return to the page everything will be saved. The project also has a timer with a start, stop and reset function so the user can track their time.

## Background design

* The color style: linear-gradient(120deg, #f6d365, #fda085) was used as a background image for this project. This gives the user a fun and beutiful color to watch instead of just one simple and same color.

## Text input field

* The text input field have a clean white background where the user can type their text of tasks. The text has been nicely centered so the text isn't stuck to the edge.

## Text input field button

* Next to the text input field the user can find a button. The button has a hover effect so it changes color when that event happens.

## Checkmark and trashcan buttons

## Unfixed bugs

* There is a problem for Mac users to click on the filter buttons. When the mac user clicks on the buttons they need to click 2 times and when a windows pc computer clicks on the button they only need to press it once. Multiple different individuals and support teams with programming experience have reviewed the bug and haven't been able to solve it yet.

## Deployment
