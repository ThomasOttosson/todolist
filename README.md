## Features

* The user writes one or more tasks that he or she needs to do. The user can later on mark each task as completed or remove the task if the user has changed their mind. The user can also use the select options to see which tasks that has been completed or uncompleted. All the actions the users take on the site will get stored in the in a local storage so when they return to the page everything will be saved.

## Background design

* The color style: linear-gradient(120deg, #f6d365, #fda085) was used as a background image for this project.

## Title

* The title was created with google fonts where "Popppins" was used and sans-serif.

## Text input field

* The text input field have a clean white background where the user can type their text of "todos". The text has been nicely centered so the text isn't stuck to the edge.

## Text input field button

* Next to the text input field the user can find a button. The button has a hover effect so it changes color when that event happens.

## "Todos"

* The "todos" pops up when the user presses the text input field button. To the right side of the "todo" item the user can find a green checkmark button and a trashcan button.

## Checkmark and trashcan buttons

* The checkmark button can be used by the user when a task is completed and will have a line-through effect with some opacity to make it look creative.

* The trachcan button can be used by the user when they want to remove a task.

## Select options button

* Here the user can choose and filter the tasks that has been completed or uncompleted. They can also pick the option of choosing all.
